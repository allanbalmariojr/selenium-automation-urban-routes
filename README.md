# 🚕 Urban Routes UI Automation Framework (Sprint 8)

This project is an automated UI testing framework for the Urban Routes web application using **Selenium WebDriver, Python, and PyTest**.

Sprint 8 focuses on converting previous procedural tests into a **Page Object Model (POM) structure**, improving scalability, maintainability, and overall test organization.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this sprint was to:

- Refactor existing Selenium tests into a **Page Object Model (POM) architecture**
- Implement proper **setup and teardown methods using PyTest class fixtures**
- Improve maintainability by separating test logic from page interactions
- Ensure complete end-to-end user flow coverage for the taxi ordering application

---

## 🧠 Key Features Implemented

### 🏗️ Page Object Model (POM)

- Created `pages.py` to store all locators and page methods
- Encapsulated all UI interactions inside the `UrbanRoutesPage` class
- Improved reusability and reduced duplication across test cases

---

### ⚙️ Test Structure Improvements

- Implemented `setup_class` and `teardown_class` methods
- Properly initialized and closed Selenium WebDriver
- Moved URL validation (`helpers.is_url_reachable`) into setup class method
- Added Chrome logging capabilities for debugging and test support

---

### 🧪 End-to-End Test Coverage

Automated full user workflows including:

- Route setup (From / To address input)
- Taxi plan selection
- Phone number authentication with SMS verification
- Payment method setup (credit card entry and confirmation)
- Driver comment input
- Additional service options (blankets, handkerchiefs, ice cream ordering)
- Final taxi order placement and confirmation validation

---

### 🕒 Synchronization Handling

- Used `WebDriverWait` and `expected_conditions`
- Improved test stability and reduced flakiness
- Ensured proper element visibility and clickability before actions
